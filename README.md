## Problem Statement - Data Copier
We would like to develop the code to copy data in files using JSON Format to a Postgres Database.

- Running the docker-compose up command builds a postres database with previously established table structue  
  and builds the python application that copies the data from JSON files to the database
  - The database creation SQL is located in the data/ direcotry
  - The application files are located in the app/ directory
  
- To copy data from files to database run the dockercommand.sh
